# Homebrew formula for the Patch CLI.
#
# The Patch engine SOURCE is private; this formula installs a pre-built,
# release, universal (arm64 + x86_64) macOS binary hosted on a public
# Google Cloud Storage bucket. New releases are published by the
# patch-cli release workflow (on a `v*` tag), which uploads the tarball
# and bumps `url` + `sha256` here.

    <<~EOS
      Get started:

        patchcli setup    # one-time: installs the Swift→WebAssembly toolchain
        patchcli init     # in your app directory: registers the app, adds the
                          # PatchSDK package, and wires up the startup code

      `patchcli setup` is only needed for commands that compile Swift to
      WebAssembly (build / release). Everything else (init, status, channels,
      rollback, whoami, fingerprint) works without it.
